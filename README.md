# EFR2020_stimuli_analysis
EFR stimulation paradigms and analysis methods

The EFR_extractor.m file can be used to extract EFR magnitudes from raw EEG recordings (and perform bootstrapping to estimate the noise floor) as described in the paper: "Enhancing the sensitivity of the envelope-following response for cochlear synaptopathy screening in humans: the role of stimulus envelope by Viacheslav Vasilkov, Markus Garrett, Manfred Mauermann and Sarah Verhulst".

The EFR_stimuli.m file generates the EFR-stimuli we used for our recordings in the publication.

Enjoy!
